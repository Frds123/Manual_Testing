This repository contains the General Test Cases for performing Manual Testing on the Web/Mobile application. It also has Test cases related to API Testing. Templates related to Test Plan and BugBash are also updated.

# What is it all about?
This project contains sample set of test cases for manual testers to help them save time for writing manual test cases. It also has the templates for the Test planning and Bug bash.
# Why was this project created?
It is always a tedious and boring task to write test cases, which takes most of the time of software testing. Hence, I decided to make generic test cases for the functionality majorly used in software testing so anyone can just download the copy and use it directly in their projects and save their time wasted in writing the generic test cases.
